  abstract = {Abstract 抽象的 Objective People who spend a longer time walking have lower demands for medical care. However, in view of their longer life expectancy, it is unclear whether their lifetime medical expenditure increases or decreases. The present study examined the association between time spent walking, life expectancy and lifetime medical expenditure.目的步行时间较长的人对医疗的需求较低。然而，鉴于他们的预期寿命较长，目前还不清楚他们的终生医疗支出是增加还是减少。本研究调查了步行时间、预期寿命和终生医疗支出之间的关系。 Method The authors followed up 27 738 participants aged 40--79 years and prospectively collected data on their medical expenditure and survival covering a 13-year-period. Participants were classified into those walking {$<$}1 and {$\geq$}1 h per day. The authors constructed life tables and estimated the life expectancy and lifetime medical expenditure from 40 years of age using estimate of multiadjusted mortality and medical expenditure using a Poisson regression model and linear regression model, respectively.方法作者对 27 738 名年龄在 40-79 岁的参与者进行了随访，前瞻性地收集了他们 13 年期间的医疗支出和生存数据。参与者被分为每天步行{$<$}1 小时和{$\geq$}1 小时的两组。作者构建了生命表，并分别使用泊松回归模型和线性回归模型估计了多重调整死亡率和医疗支出，估计了 40 岁起的预期寿命和终生医疗支出。 Results Participants who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day have a longer life expectancy from 40 years of age than participants who walked {$<$}1 h per day. The multiadjusted life expectancy for those who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day was 44.81 years, significantly lower by 1.38 years in men (p=0.0073) in men and 57.78 years in women, non-significantly lower by 1.16 years in women (p=0.2351). In addition to their longer life expectancy, participants who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day required a lower lifetime medical expenditure from 40 years of age than participants who walked {$<$}1 h per day. The multiadjusted lifetime medical expenditure for those who walked {$\geq$}1 h per day was {\pounds}99 423.6, significantly lower by 7.6\% in men (p=0.0048) and {\pounds}128 161.2, non-significantly lower by 2.7\% in women (p=0.2559).结果每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的参与者从 40 岁起的预期寿命比每天步行 {$<$}1 小时的参与者更长。每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的人的多重调整预期寿命为 44.81 岁，男性显着降低 1.38 岁 (p=0.0073)，女性为 57.78 岁，女性非显着降低 1.16 岁 (p=0.2351) ）。除了预期寿命更长外，每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的参与者比每天步行 {$<$}1 小时的参与者从 40 岁起需要的终生医疗支出更低。每天步行 {$\geq$}1 小时的患者经多重调整后的终生医疗支出为 99 423.6 英镑，男性显着降低 7.6\% (p=0.0048)，女性为 128 161.2 英镑，非显着降低 2.7\% (p=0.2559) 。 Discussion Increased longevity resulting from a healthier lifestyle does not necessarily translate into an increased amount of medical expenditure throughout life. Encouraging people to walk may extend life expectancy and decrease lifetime medical expenditure, especially for men.讨论更健康的生活方式带来的寿命延长并不一定意味着一生中医疗支出的增加。鼓励人们步行可以延长预期寿命并减少终生医疗支出，特别是对于男性而言。},

  abstract = {Background: Among older people, walking is a popular and prevalent activity. Walking is key to increasing physical activity levels and resulting physical and mental health. In the context of rapidly ageing populations, it is important to better understand what factors are associated with walking among older people, based on the socioecological model of health. Methods: We used data from Understanding Society (n:6450), a national panel survey of UK adults aged 65 years and over living in Great Britain. Slope Indices of Inequality (SII) were calculated for weekly walking hours for older people according to individual, social and area characteristics. These include health, loneliness and social isolation, previous walking and sporting activity, residential self-selection, contact with neighbours, number of close friends and social activity. Spatial area-level data described local area crime, walkability, and proximity to retail, greenspace, and public transport amenities. Results: Multivariable models indicated that poor health, particularly requiring help with walking, was the strongest predictor of weekly walking hours (SII (95\% CI) comparing those needing help vs. no help: 3.58 ( 4.30, 2.87)). However, both prior sporting activity (most vs. least active: 2.30 (1.75, 2.88)) and walking for pleasure (yes vs. no: 1.92 (1.32, 2.53)) were strongly associated with increased walking several years later. Similarly having close friends (most vs. fewest, 1.18 (0.72, 1.77)) and local retail destinations (any vs. none: 0.93 (0.00, 1.86)) were associated with more weekly walking. Conclusions: Past engagement in physical activity and walking for pleasure are strong predictors of walking behaviour in older people, underscoring the importance of implementing and sustaining walking interventions across the lifespan to ensure continued engagement in later years and the associated health benefits. However, poor health significantly impedes walking in this demographic, emphasising the need for interventions that offer both physical assistance and social support to promote this activity.},

This article describes the findings from an empirical study examining the relationship between physical environmental characteristics of path segments and their use for walking for recreation or instrumental reasons by 114 active residents on three retirement community campuses. The study uses a combination of methods---resident questionnaires, path assessment, and morphological analysis of building and campus plans. Path use for instrumental walking was related to path segments being well-connected in the path network and having specific destinations along them. Path segments that were likely to be selected for recreational walking at the three case study sites were longer, were well connected, did not have steps, and had attractive views of campus.},

  abstract = {China is on the brink of transitioning into an aged society, resulting in a growing demand for an age-friendly street-built environment. However, previous research has paid limited attention to the differentiated walking needs of older adults. To address this gap, this study investigated the relationship between street-built environments and the subjective perception of older adults with different physical capabilities, focusing on safety, comfort, and interest. The older adults were classified into three types based on their physical mobility abilities. The TrueSkill algorithm was used to develop an online image selection website to obtain perception scores for sampled pictures from these three types of older adults. Image segmentation and deep learning were combined to extract indices of street view factors, and machine learning was used to train a scoring prediction model for all streetscape pictures of the area. The study found differences in the subjective perception among all three types of older adults, namely independent elderly (A), mediated-assisted elderly (B), and dependent elderly (C). Type A older adults might be attracted to factors related to the interest of walking despite their negative impact on safety and comfort; Type B older adults were more concerned about street conditions for safety and comfort. Type C older adults were prone to the convenience of barrier-free access and visibility. This study contributes to the study of walkability by providing a research framework for the subjective walking perceptions of older adults with different physical capabilities. Additionally, the visualized walkability map can serve as a reference for architects and urban designers, further strengthening the development of age-friendly communities with the aid of human-centric computational analysis, evaluation, and design.},
